pathlib - "high-level" path operations and extra i/o stuff
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html
    PurePath - path operations
    Path/Concrete Path - PurePath with i/o operations
    Posix and Windows flavors
    How is flavor actually determined?
        os.name == 'nt' (Windows) or not (POSIX)
        https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/ba16324b276c7b2b5ecf09479f30fc82c12192ae/Lib/pathlib.py#L469

    Flavor respects CASE rules of it's Operating System; Windows pathst aren't case sensitive.
    Test speed of purepath vs concrete path
        pure paths are barely faster (makes sense), but probably doesn't matter.
        You just use Path by default to make it simpler
    do i/o operations close automatically (write_text, write_bytes, read_text, read_bytes)?
        yes they do - nice for simple reading/writing
os.path - "low-level" path operations

os.Pathlike - ABC for pathlib and os.path objects


os path was created to centrallize path operations - "Object-oriented filesystem paths"


/ vs .joinpath()

path parts - name, suffix, stem, anchor, parent

.iterdir, .glob, .rglob

stat()


"The OS library will return a string, whereas the Pathlib will return an object of PosixPath. The benefit of having PosixPath returned is that we can directly use the returned object to do a lot more further operations. This will be demonstrated in later sections."

"remembering some of the os methods (such as os.path.expanduser) is difficult"
