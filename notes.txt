pathlib - "high-level" path operations and extra i/o stuff

    PurePath - path operations
    Path/Concrete Path - PurePath with i/o operations
    Posix and Windows flavors
    How is flavor actually determined?
        os.name == 'nt' (Windows) or not (POSIX)

    Flavor respects CASE rules of it's Operating System; Windows pathst aren't case sensitive.
    Test speed of purepath vs concrete path
        pure paths are barely faster (makes sense), but probably doesn't matter.
        You just use Path by default to make it simpler
    do i/o operations close automatically (write_text, write_bytes, read_text, read_bytes)?
        yes they do - nice for simple reading/writing
os.path - "low-level" path operations
